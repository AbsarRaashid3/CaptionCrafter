# CaptionCrafter
CaptionCrafter is a vision-language fine-tuning project that combines the power of BLIP-2 and the efficiency of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to generate intelligent, human-like captions for images. Using the Flickr8k dataset, this project showcases how to fine-tune large multimodal models for image captioning tasks in a memory-efficient way.
